## Data Structures

- **Array:** Implementation of dynamic arrays with various operations.
- **Linked List:** Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Stack:** Implementation of stack data structure using arrays and linked lists.
- **Queue:** Implementation of queue data structure using arrays and linked lists.
- **Tree:** Implementation of binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and more.
- **Graph:** Implementation of graphs using adjacency matrix and adjacency list.
- **Hash Table:** Implementation of hash tables with various hashing techniques.

## Algorithms

- **Sorting Algorithms:** Implementations of bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort.
- **Searching Algorithms:** Implementations of linear search, binary search, depth-first search (DFS), and breadth-first search (BFS).
- **Dynamic Programming:** Examples of dynamic programming solutions for common problems.
- **Greedy Algorithms:** Examples of greedy algorithm solutions for common problems.

## Installation

To use this repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/njoromyke/dsa-typescript.git
```

Then, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd dsa-typescript
npm start
```

## Usage

You can run the implementations and tests using the following command:

```bash
node dist/name-of-file.js
```

This will execute the test cases for all data structures and algorithms to ensure they are working correctly.
